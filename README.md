# MongoDB Cursor toArray() Blocking Event Loop

This repository demonstrates a common issue in MongoDB Node.js driver usage: blocking the event loop when converting a cursor to an array using `toArray()` synchronously.  This is problematic, particularly with large datasets, leading to unresponsiveness and poor application performance.  The example shows both the incorrect and correct approaches, emphasizing the importance of asynchronous operations when dealing with MongoDB cursors.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file showcases the use of `cursor.toArray()` synchronously, which blocks the event loop. The correct implementation is demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`.  Note that in real applications, you should always use asynchronous methods, to avoid blocking, handle errors gracefully, and ensure application responsiveness.
